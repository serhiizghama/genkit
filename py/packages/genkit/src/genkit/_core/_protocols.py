"""Leaf module of structural interfaces (Protocols) for core Genkit types.

Keeping interfaces here instead of in their implementation modules breaks
circular-import cycles.  The pattern is:

    Module A needs B's type in annotations, but B depends on A → cycle.
    Solution: extract B's interface here; A imports the interface, not B.

Currently defined:

- ``RegistryLike`` — structural Protocol covering the registry methods that
                   middleware and the generate engine actually call.  Use instead
                   of the concrete ``Registry`` whenever a cycle would result.
                   The real ``Registry`` satisfies it structurally; no
                   ``register`` call or inheritance is needed.

    """Structural interface for the subset of Registry used by middleware and the generate engine.

    Middleware plugins (e.g. ``Fallback``) and ``generate_action`` depend only
    on this interface, not the full concrete ``Registry``.  This avoids pulling
    in ``_registry.py`` from modules that ``_registry.py`` itself depends on.

    The concrete ``Registry`` satisfies this protocol structurally — no
    subclassing or registration is required.
